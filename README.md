# Vulkan Renderer



### Introduction
This is a Vulkan rendering engine that I built after following Brendan Galea's Vulkan tutorials on YouTube. 

Link to the tutorial series:

### Requirements
If you are interested in running this on your system, ensure that you use Vulkan SDL version 1.3.268.0 .
Rest of the external dependencies such as stb_image, Assimp, GLM, Dear ImGUI etc. have been added as submodules in the ```external/``` subdirectory.

### Features added

Some features added to this renderer project:
 - Directional Lighting
 - Cascaded Shadow Mapping
 - Basic Texture/Material management
 - Memory management with VMA
